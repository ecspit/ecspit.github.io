            Since begining to tutor GCSE Maths students in October 2023, teaching and working with young people to improve not just in mathematics but also as people has been a driving passion of mine. Here is a collection of resources and information relating to tutoring.

              Mainly specializing in 1 to 1 lessons, I provide a safe and engaging space where students are able to
              discuss, learn and explore without fear of getting a question wrong or feeling under pressure.
            </p>
            <p>
              My lessons are first and foremost dependent on the studentâ€™s needs and questions. If the student has no outstanding queries then I work with the student to find areas of weakness and work on them, whether it be through targeted past paper practice, general topic revision or even working through worksheets that I personally create and tailor to the student.
            </p>
            <p>
              I believe that empathy and understanding are insurmountable when it comes to teaching, the last thing someone wants when they are having a bad day is to have yet another person hammering on their door. Patience and understanding in lessons does not always attract the most attention compared to concrete results, yet I believe it is at least as important and should not be overlooked.
